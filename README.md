Women have diverse health needs that are often not adequately addressed by generic healthcare approaches. This lack of personalization can lead to suboptimal health outcomes and limited access to relevant services.

We have developed a data-driven solution using Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models to segment women based on their health needs and preferences, aiming to create personalized healthcare recommendations
Used advanced clustering algorithms to segment women by health needs and preferences, enabling personalized healthcare recommendations that enhance service access, improve outcomes, and adapt to evolving health trends through machine learning.
